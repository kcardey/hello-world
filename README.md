# hello-world
My first repository

Originally from Napa, CA where my parents still live.
Went to school at Stanford to study Economics. I graduated in 2013.
Moved to San Francisco, CA to begin my career in the software industry.
I now work at a company called Retain.ai. I was employee #3 and have helped the company grow a lot since I joined.
My interests include growth investing, bitcoin, defi, backpacking, and generally anything outdoors.
My superpower is range. I can learn anything and I can do it quickly.
